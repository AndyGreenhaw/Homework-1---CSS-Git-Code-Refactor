## Summary

This program includes refractored code for the Horiseon website, following the instructions provided. Among other changes, included in comments throughout the code, I replaced generic div tags with semantic tags, I added alt tags to images, and I optimized many of the elements for search engines following basic SEO principles.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

[Header] The Header area includes the website header and the navigation bar. 
[Nav] The Nav area, which is wrapped within the header section, includes the navigavtion tools at the top of the page.
* [Main] The Main area is broken up into three sections, and includes the primary service categrories.
* [Aside]The Aside area includes the elements along the right side of the page, broken into three sections.
* [Footer] The Footer includes all the boiler plate information at the bottom of the page, and was not changed in this update.
